# LangGraph-Based-Agentic-Cybersecurity-Workflow
CybersecurityAgent is a dynamic, LangGraph-based security audit pipeline that converts high-level instructions into sequential tasks executed via Dockerized tools (Gobuster, FFUF, SQLMap). It enforces user-defined target scopes, manages retries, logs activities, and generates a comprehensive final audit report.
